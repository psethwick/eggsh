# eggsh

## Why

- I want to write an intepreter
- I want to learn Zig
- Shells are cool, and although there are many alternative shells.. why not one more

## Possible directions

- what if you could customise your readline/terminal experience as much as say emacs or (neo)vim
- graphical terminal sidecar (data vis, interactivity?)
- wasm plugin system
- I would say first class lua, but hilbish exists

## Goals

- First class functions / procedures
- A big enough toolkit for command composition

## Non Goals (at least for now)

- POSIX compatibility
- for it to be fun/useful for anyone but me
